Project Overview: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub on AWS
This project demonstrates the setup of a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub on AWS. The pipeline is designed to automatically deploy a Dockerized application to an EC2 instance whenever code is committed to a GitHub repository. Below are the detailed steps and commands used throughout the project.
________________________________________
Step 1: Push Code to GitHub Repository
Before setting up Jenkins or any other infrastructure, ensure your code is stored in a GitHub repository. This allows Jenkins to pull the latest code whenever changes are made.
1.	Create a new repository on GitHub:
o	Go to GitHub and create a new repository named ansible-jenkins.
o	Clone the repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-jenkins.git
cd ansible-jenkins
2.	Add your project files to the repository and push them to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-jenkins.git
git push -u origin main
Step 2: Set Up GitHub Webhook to Trigger Jenkins
To automate the deployment process, you need to set up a webhook in GitHub that triggers Jenkins whenever code is pushed to the repository.
1.	Configure Webhook:
o	Go to your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Webhooks.
o	Click on Add webhook.
o	In the Payload URL, enter your Jenkins server URL followed by /github-webhook/, e.g., http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/.
o	Set Content type to application/json.
o	Choose Just the push event to trigger the build on every push.
o	Click Add webhook.
Step 3: Provision AWS EC2 Instances
1.	Create two Ubuntu EC2 instances on AWS.
o	Name one instance jenkins (for the Jenkins server) and the other docker (for running Docker containers).
2.	Open necessary ports in the security groups for both instances:
o	Jenkins instance: Open port 8080 for Jenkins, and port 22 for SSH.
o	Docker instance: Open ports 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 22 for SSH.
Step 4: Install and Configure Jenkins on the Jenkins Instance
1.	SSH into the Jenkins EC2 instance:
bash

Project Overview: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub on AWS
This project outlines the process of setting up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub on AWS. The pipeline is designed to automatically build, test, and deploy a Dockerized web application to an AWS EC2 instance whenever changes are committed to a GitHub repository. This detailed guide walks through each step, explaining the key commands and configurations used.
________________________________________
Step 1: Push Code to GitHub Repository
Before setting up Jenkins or other infrastructure, the first step is to store your code in a GitHub repository. This allows Jenkins to pull the latest code automatically whenever changes are committed.
1.	Create a GitHub Repository:
o	Visit GitHub and create a new repository named ansible-jenkins.
o	Once the repository is created, clone it to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-jenkins.git
cd ansible-jenkins
This command creates a local copy of your repository where you can manage your project files.
2.	Add Project Files and Push to GitHub:
o	Initialize the repository and add your project files:
bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
o	Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit of the project"
o	Link your local repository to the GitHub repository and push the changes:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-jenkins.git
git push -u origin main
Explanation:
o	git init initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.
o	git add . stages all the files in the current directory for commit.
o	git commit -m "message" commits the staged files with a descriptive message.
o	git remote add origin <URL> connects the local repository to the remote repository hosted on GitHub.
o	git push -u origin main pushes the committed files to the main branch on GitHub.
This step ensures that your codebase is version-controlled and accessible to Jenkins.
________________________________________
Step 2: Set Up GitHub Webhook to Trigger Jenkins
To automate the deployment process, set up a webhook in GitHub to trigger Jenkins whenever code is pushed to the repository.
1.	Configure GitHub Webhook:
o	In your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Webhooks.
o	Click on Add webhook.
o	Set the Payload URL to your Jenkins server URL followed by /github-webhook/. For example:
arduino
Copy code
http://<jenkins-instance-ip>:8080/github-webhook/
o	Set the Content type to application/json.
o	Choose Just the push event to trigger the build on every push to the repository.
o	Click Add webhook.
Explanation:
o	A webhook is a way for an application (GitHub) to send real-time data to another application (Jenkins). In this case, the webhook notifies Jenkins whenever a push event occurs in the GitHub repository, triggering the Jenkins pipeline.
________________________________________
Step 3: Provision AWS EC2 Instances
Provisioning EC2 instances on AWS is necessary to host Jenkins and Docker, which will be used to manage and deploy the application.
1.	Create Two Ubuntu EC2 Instances:
o	Jenkins Instance: This instance will host Jenkins, which will manage the CI/CD pipeline.
o	Docker Instance: This instance will run Docker containers that host the application.
Steps:

4.	Start Jenkins and Verify Installation:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
Explanation:
o	sudo systemctl start jenkins starts the Jenkins service.
o	sudo systemctl status jenkins checks if Jenkins is running correctly.
5.	Access Jenkins Web Interface:
o	Open a web browser and navigate to http://<jenkins-instance-ip>:8080.
o	Use the initial admin password located in the file /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword:
bash
Copy code
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Explanation:
o	sudo cat displays the content of the initial password file, which you’ll need to unlock the Jenkins setup wizard.
6.	Install Suggested Plugins and Configure Jenkins:
o	Once you access the Jenkins web interface, follow the setup wizard to install the suggested plugins.
o	Create an admin user and finish the configuration.
Explanation:
o	Jenkins plugins extend the functionality of Jenkins. The setup wizard helps in installing essential plugins automatically.

bash
Copy code
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@<docker-instance-ip>
Explanation:
o	This step connects to the Docker instance in the same way you connected to the Jenkins instance.
2.	Install Docker:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
Explanation:
o	sudo apt install docker.io -y installs Docker from the Ubuntu package repository.
3.	Add the ubuntu User to the Docker Group:
bash
Copy code
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
Explanation:
o	usermod -aG docker ubuntu adds the ubuntu user to the docker group, allowing the user to run Docker commands without sudo.
4.	Test the Docker Installation:
bash
Copy code
docker run hello-world
Explanation:
o	docker run hello-world runs a test container provided by Docker to verify that the installation is working.
________________________________________
Step 6: Configure Jenkins for the CI/CD Pipeline
With Jenkins installed and Docker ready on another instance, the next step is to configure Jenkins to automate the deployment of your application.
1.	Install Jenkins Plugins:
o	Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins in the Jenkins web interface and install the following plugins:
	Git Plugin (for pulling code from GitHub)
	Ansible Plugin (for running Ansible playbooks)
	Docker Pipeline Plugin (for integrating Docker with Jenkins)
Explanation:
o	Jenkins plugins enhance the functionality of Jenkins by allowing it to interact with tools like Git, Ansible, and Docker.
2.	Create a New Jenkins Pipeline:
o	Go to New Item in Jenkins and create a new pipeline project named docker-deploy.
Explanation:
o	A pipeline in Jenkins defines the series of steps that will be executed to achieve continuous integration and deployment.
3.	Configure the Pipeline to Pull Code from GitHub:
o	Under Pipeline settings, select Pipeline script from SCM.
o	Set the SCM to Git and provide the GitHub repository URL.
o	Add the repository credentials (username and access token).
Explanation:
o	Pipeline script from SCM instructs Jenkins to use a Jenkinsfile stored in the repository to define the pipeline stages.
________________________________________
Step 7: Set Up Ansible for Configuration Management
Ansible will be used to automate the configuration and deployment of the Docker containers.
1.	Install Ansible on the Jenkins Instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
Explanation:
o	ansible is installed on the Jenkins instance so it can be used to manage the Docker instance.
2.	Set Up SSH Keys for Ansible:
o	Generate an SSH key pair on the Jenkins instance to allow Ansible to connect to the Docker instance without a password:
bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "jenkins@jenkins"
o	Copy the public key to the Docker instance:
bash
Copy code
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ubuntu@<docker-instance-ip>
Explanation:
o	ssh-keygen generates a new SSH key pair.
o	ssh-copy-id copies the public key to the authorized_keys file on the Docker instance, enabling passwordless SSH login.
3.	Configure Ansible Hosts File:
o	Edit the /etc/ansible/hosts file to include the Docker instance:
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
o	Add the following lines:
bash
Copy code
[webserver]
<docker-instance-ip> ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
Explanation:
o	The Ansible hosts file defines the target machines (like the Docker instance) that Ansible will manage.
o	ansible_python_interpreter is specified because Ansible uses Python scripts, and this ensures compatibility with the installed Python version on the target machine.
4.	Create an Ansible Playbook to Deploy Docker Containers:
o	Create a file named deploy.yml in your project directory:
bash
Copy code
nano deploy.yml
o	Add the following content to the playbook:
yaml
Copy code
- hosts: webserver
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Pull the latest Docker image
      docker_image:
        name: your-docker-image
        source: pull

    - name: Run the Docker container
      docker_container:
        name: mycontainer
        image: your-docker-image
        state: started
        ports:
          - "80:80"
Explanation:
o	This playbook instructs Ansible to pull the latest Docker image from a repository and run it on the Docker instance, mapping port 80 on the container to port 80 on the instance.
________________________________________
Step 8: Finalize Jenkins Pipeline Script
Integrate the Ansible playbook into the Jenkins pipeline to automate the deployment process.
1.	Edit the Jenkinsfile in Your GitHub Repository:
bash
Copy code

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Pull Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-jenkins.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Ansible Playbook') {
            steps {
                ansiblePlaybook colorized: true, playbook: 'deploy.yml'
            }
        }
    }
}
Explanation:
o	The Jenkinsfile defines the CI/CD pipeline stages.
o	The Pull Code stage pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
o	The Run Ansible Playbook stage executes the deploy.yml playbook to deploy the Docker container.
2.	Commit and Push the Jenkinsfile to GitHub:
